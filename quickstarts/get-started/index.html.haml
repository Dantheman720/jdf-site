%p
  JBoss Developer Framework ships with a number of quickstarts that show you how to get started with a variety of technologies in JBoss AS. You'll find out how to write a web application using the latest Java EE technologies like CDI and JAX-RS. How to write client libraries to talk to JBoss AS using web services, JMS or EJB. How to set up a distributed transaction, and how to recover from a transaction failure. And much, much more.

%p 
  Quickstarts are very focused - they demonstrate on a single API (e.g. JAX-RS) or a single use case (write a web-app with CRUD).
