JBoss Developer Framework is use case focused, and every release focuses on three new use cases.

Some future ideas for use cases to focus on include:

* No more EJBs - everything you need with POJos, backed by DeltaSpike
* SSO - the power of PicketLink
* Social - thanks Agorava!
* Business Process Management from jBPM!
