JBoss Developer Framework is use case focused, and every tri-annual release focuses on two new use cases.

Some future ideas for use cases to focus on include:

* Identity and SSO - the power of PicketLink
* Social - thanks Agorava!
* Going native, with Aerogear on mobile
* Asynchronous application development via vert.x

Looking further ahead:

* we're planning to add new ways to learn. We're inspired by koans and codeschool.
* we plan to cover the whole JBoss product line, showing you how to use all it's APIs, both separately and together.
* make sure that everything we show is mobile friendly, testable, tooled up, and runs on OpenShift
