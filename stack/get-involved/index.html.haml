  Found a bug on some of JBoss Stacks item ? Think there is a BOM/Archetype/Stack missing?
 
  Then you probably want to [report an issue](https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jdf-stack/issues).

  The information about the Stacks is readily accessible. The JBoss Stacks is mantained in a YAML file available at [JBoss Stacks repo](https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jdf-stack/blob/master/stacks.yaml). For better compreending the file format, JDF provides [this diagram](https://raw.github.com/jboss-jdf/jdf-stack/master/fileformat.png) that represents the lastest file format version.

  If you plan on contributing to the project, we encourage you to clone the one of the JBoss Stacs item repositories.
