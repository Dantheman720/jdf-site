If you want to contribute an example, follow these guidelines:

* As an example is a large piece of work, we strongly encourage you to discuss your planned example on the [dev list](#{site.base_url}/forums/jdf-dev) before starting.
* Make sure you have reviewed the general guidelines for sample projects, to understand the basic guidelines you should follow.
* Each example lives in its own repository. Take a look at [TicketMonster](https://github.com/jboss-jdf/ticket-monster) as template repository.
* Take a look at Maven POM Versions Checklist if you want to add dependencies to your project
* When your quickstart is ready for review, let the JBoss Develoepr Framework team know on the [dev list](#{site.base_url}/forums/jdf-dev).
