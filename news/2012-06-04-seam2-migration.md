post_title: Seam 2 Migration to Vanilla Java EE 6

Our first migration covered is the Open 18 application from Seam in Action by
Dan Allen. Version 1.0.0.Final is a direct migration to Vanilla Java EE 6, with
one CDI extension to create a replica of the JSF 2 ViewScope. It does not
include any security (that's certainly a sore spot in Java EE) nor BPM
integration. Look forward to other updates to the migration to include security
and other features! [Documentation of the migration](#{site.base_url}/migrations/seam2/open18_migration/) 
has more information.
