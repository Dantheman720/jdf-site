Welcome to JBoss Developer Framework!

JBoss Developer Framework exists to show you, the developer, to make the most of JBoss and Java EE 6 technologies on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and JBoss AS.

![JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and JBoss AS](#{site.base_url}/images/dualbrand_as7eap.png)

We have three ways to do this:

Quickstarts
-----------

We start small, with the [quickstarts](#{site.base_url}/quickstarts/get-started). Each quickstart is veru focused, and shows you one API, or one use case. There are about 53 quickstarts today, ranging from JAX-RS CRUD to GWT to HTML5 to transactions.

If you can't find the quickstart you are looking for, then please [tell us](#{site.base_url}/quickstarts/get-involved) and, together, we'll see what we can do!

Examples
--------

Quickstarts are great, but there comes a time in everyone's life when they want to write something other than a simple application! [TicketMonster](#{site.base_url}/examples/get-started) steps up to the plate at this point. Today, it's a full web-app written, with front-ends showing off the three approaches to view layers we like at JBoss - HTML 5 + REST, Errai/GWT and RichFaces/JSF.

Over time, we plan to add much more to TicketMonster, as well as spin up other examples. Check out the [Roadmap](#{site.base_url}/about/roadmap) for more info on our plans!

Migrations
----------

Fnally, we realise that there are lots of people still using older technologies such as Seam 2, Spring or Java EE 5. We've put together a comprehensive set of migration tutorials to [show you how](#{site.base_url}/migrations/get-started/).

JBoss BOMs
----------

To make all this possible, we've developed [a set of BOMs](#{site.base_url}/stack/jboss-bom). The BOMs start with Java EE 6, and build on that base API with JBoss extensions such as Hibernate (Search, Validator...), Errai and Arquillian. They're a great way to make sure you're using the same set of dependences that we test with!

Get Involved

Enjoy!
