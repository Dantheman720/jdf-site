In the past two weeks we have been working to improve our demos and tutorials. As a result, I'm happy to announce that a new and improved version of TicketMonster is available. The changes include:

* the service layer has been refactored for handling concurrent requests better;
* various fixes in the HTML5 application;
* added pagination to the 'Bookings' view;
* improved installation instructions; 
* tutorials have been updated to match the new source code.


You can see the new version of the application running in the [cloud](http://ticketmonster-jdf.rhcloud.com) or [download it from GitHub](https://github.com/jboss-jdf/ticket-monster/zipball/1.0.2.Final).
