  We're always looking for your war story on migrating to JBoss.

  If you would like to provide a post for our [war stories archive](../war-stories), then you can [fork this site](#{site.website_source_repo}), add a post to `migrations/war-stories` in Markdown format, and send a pull request.

  We're always on the look out for migration guides. If you have one you want to share, [let us know](#{site.base_url}/forums). Here's some ideas:

  * WebLogic -> JBoss & Java EE 6
  * WebSphere -> JBoss & Java EE 6 
  * Tomcat -> JBoss & Java EE 6
