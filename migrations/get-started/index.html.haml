  JBoss Developer Framework provides guides for migrating to Java EE 6 from Seam 2, Spring and Java EE 5.

  * [Seam 2 -> Java EE 6](../seam2/open18_migration)
  * [Spring -> Java EE 6](spring)
  * [Java EE 5 -> Java EE 6](javaee5)
    * [JBoss AS 5 or JBoss AS 6 -> JBoss AS 7](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/How+do+I+migrate+my+application+from+AS5+or+AS6+to+AS7)

  Ok, but when do I migrate?
  --------------------------

  Having read the migration guides you now have some ideas about how to migrate, but how do you decide when to migrate?

      %th Classic Seam 2
      %th Seam 2 mixed with Java EE 6

      %strong Scenario
    %td(rowspan="2") You have a working application, and aren't looking to make significant changes right now.
    %td(rowspan="2") You want to start taking advantage of features of Java EE 6, such as JSF 2, Bean Validaton or JPA 2. You don't want to undertake a full migration today.
    %td(colspan="3") You've fallen head over heals for Java EE 6, and want to migrate your application today.
  %tr
    %td 
      :markdown
        You have all the features you need in Java EE 6, with a choice of HTML5, Errai, or RichFaces for the view layer. Take a look at [TicketMonster](#{site.base_url}/examples/get-started) to see what you can achieve!
    %td 
      :markdown
        You have all the features you need in Java EE 6, [DeltaSpike](https://cwiki.apache.org/DeltaSpike/) etc. and are happy living on the edge.

        Choose Java EE 6 on [JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6](http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/application-platform/) or [JBoss AS 7](http://jboss.org/jbossas). [JBoss Developer Framework](#{site.base_url}) provides a good resource to learn the stack. Subscription available.

        Choose Java EE 6 on [JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6](http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/application-platform/) or [JBoss AS 7](http://jboss.org/jbossas), and add in what you need yourself. Only parts of the stack will be covered by a Red Hat subscription.
